### Monika's Task
    ## Next Steps:

    - Finish implementing the `execute_command` function.
    - Builtins.
    - Implement error handling.
    ## Next Steps:

    - Finish implementing the `execute_command` function. This function should handle all the commands that your shell is supposed to support.
    - Implement the `print_prompt` function in prompt.c.
    - Implement command history functionality. You've already added a `command_history` field to the `t_minishell` struct, but it's not being used yet.
    - Implement error handling. You've started this with the `ft_error_msg` function, but you need to make sure that all possible errors are handled.
    - Test your shell to make sure it works as expected and trying out different commands.
